## 4. Neuronenblitz Algorithm
### 4.1 Overview
Neuronenblitz is MARBLE's core adaptive exploration and learning mechanism. It performs stochastic wandering over the neural graph while adjusting synaptic weights and structure.

### 4.2 Data structures
- State objects tracking route potentials, synapse fatigue, context history, wander cache and subpath cache.
- Dynamic attention span module controlling focus across neuron types.

### 4.3 Dynamic wander algorithm
1. Start from a given neuron; set depth d = 0.
2. At each step choose among outgoing synapses using potential scores p_s and exploration noise:
   P(s_i) = e^{p_{s_i}/\tau} / \sum_j e^{p_{s_j}/\tau}.
3. Update route potential for traversed synapse:
   p' = \min(cap, p * route_potential_decay + route_potential_increase).
4. Track depth and terminate when d >= max_wander_depth or target reached.
5. With probability backtrack_probability and depth < backtrack_depth_limit, backtrack one step and retry.
6. Apply dropout by removing each candidate synapse with probability dropout_probability.
7. If target neuron resides on a remote tier, invoke `remote_client.process` with
   timeout; optionally fall back to local processing or torrent shard via
   `torrent_client`.
8. Bias initial path via episodic memory replay for up to
   `episodic_sim_length` steps.
9. Optionally perform beam search of width b to keep top-b paths scored by
   cumulative potential and novelty.
10. Cache explored subpaths with resulting neuron values in a wander cache with
    TTL and LRU eviction; reuse cached paths when `apply_plasticity` is False.
11. After each wander decay route potentials and prune low-potential synapses at
    configured intervals.

### 4.4 Output computation
- Each neuron's output is computed by applying combine_fn over inputs x and weights w:
  y = max(x * w, 0) (default).
- Loss is computed as ell = loss_fn(t, y) or via loss_module.

### 4.5 Validation and learning
1. Compute validation scale v = validation_fn(t, y).
2. Error e = v * ell.
3. For each synapse with source value s and path length L:
   - Raw gradient Δ = weight_update_fn(s, e, L) (default Δ = (e·s)/(L+1)).
   - Eligibility-modulated gradient Δ' = Δ * eligibility_trace.
   - v' = β v_prev + (1-β)Δ'^2
   - scaled = Δ'/√(v'+ε)
   - m' = μ m_prev + scaled
   - update = lr*(μ m' + scaled)
   - phase_factor = cos(φ_syn - φ_global); if chaotic gating enabled multiply by g(t)
   - fatigue gate = max(0, 1 - fatigue)
   - activity gate = 1/(1 + visit_count^{activity_gate_exponent})
   - update *= phase_factor * fatigue_gate * activity_gate
   - cap = synapse_update_cap / (1 + depth_clip_scaling*(L/max_wander_depth))
   - w ← clip(w + update, ±weight_limit)
   - potential ← min(synapse_potential_cap, potential + |scaled|*gradient_score_scale)
   - score = |e|*|w|/max(L,1)*(1+memory_gate)
4. Accumulate updates for gradient_accumulation_steps then apply and optionally weight_decay.
5. Store paths with error below episodic_memory_threshold into episodic_memory.
6. GPU path uses kernel nb_apply_launcher implementing the same operations in parallel.

### 4.6 Structural plasticity
- For each traversed synapse with potential ≥ plasticity_threshold and dropout check passed:
  - Create new neuron with representation (source.rep + target.rep)/2 and tier promotion (vram→ram→disk).
  - w1 = syn.weight * struct_weight_multiplier1 * mod * structural_learning_rate * (1 + rep_sim).
  - w2 = syn.weight * struct_weight_multiplier2 * mod * structural_learning_rate * (1 + rep_sim).
  - Add synapse source→new_id with weight w1 and new_id→target with weight w2.
  - Remove original synapse and log event with timestamp and potential.
- Merge similar synapses if weight difference < merge_tolerance.
- Prune synapses every synapse_prune_interval steps when potential < synapse_potential_cap.
### 4.7 Attention and fatigue
- Update type-specific attention:
  a' = a * attention_decay + attention_update_scale * activity.
- Synaptic fatigue:
  f' = f * fatigue_decay + fatigue_increase * activity.
- Attention span threshold controls dynamic span module.
- Context-aware attention layer computes
  \(\text{softmax}(((Q+ctx)(K+ctx)^T)/\sqrt{d})\) with optional chaotic gating and causal masks.

### 4.8 Caching and parallel wandering
- `dynamic_wander_parallel` spawns multiple processes using `mp.Pool` with
  seeds; main process replays each path to apply updates.
- `chaotic_memory_replay` perturbs inputs via logistic map
  \(x_{n+1} = r x_n (1-x_n)\) and concatenates resulting paths.
- Wander cache stores tuples `(output, path, timestamp)` and expires entries
  after `wander_cache_ttl`, evicting LRU when exceeding `_cache_max_size`.
- Exploration bonus decays each activation:
  `exploration_bonus <- exploration_bonus * exploration_decay`.

### 4.9 Synapse-type attention and actions
- Track cumulative loss, speed and size attention per synapse type.
- `decide_synapse_action` creates a new synapse of the highest-loss type or
  removes one of the highest-size type.
- Gradient pruning:
  - `compute_gradient_prune_mask(r)` selects the lowest \(r\) fraction of
    gradients using `np.partition`.
  - `apply_gradient_prune_mask` deletes flagged synapses and associated
    optimiser state.

### 4.10 Dataset-aware training modes
- `refresh_on_dataset_change` monitors directories via `DatasetWatcher` and
  resets learning state when files change.
- `train_streaming_shards` iterates through `BitTensorDataset` shards using
  `StreamingDatasetStep` with asynchronous prefetching.
- `contrastive_train` applies InfoNCE to augmented batches; `imitation_train`
  performs behaviour cloning on demonstration pairs.

### 4.11 State management
- `to_dict`/`from_dict` and JSON helpers serialise Neuronenblitz without the
  core object.
- `reset_learning_state` clears momentum, eligibility traces, caches and replay
  buffers, ensuring fresh training runs.
- Dynamic attention span `_apply_attention_span` masks path elements according
  to `span_module` outputs.

### 4.12 Neurogenesis coupling
- Neuronenblitz exposes neuron type preferences to `MarbleBrain` for growth decisions.
- During neurogenesis, the brain queries either
  \(t^* = \text{get\_preferred\_neuron\_type}()\) or
  combined attention \(t^*_{comb}\) when using multiple spans.
- Newly created neurons and synapses are initialized with representation noise
  \(\mathcal{N}(0, \text{representation\_noise\_std})\) and weight range
  \([\text{weight\_init\_min}, \text{weight\_init\_max}]\).

### 4.13 Reinforcement learning integration
- Q-learning weight update for state-action pair (s,a):
  Q(s,a) <- Q(s,a) + alpha * (r + gamma * max_a' Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)).
- Epsilon scheduling:
  eps_{t+1} = max(rl_min_epsilon, eps_t * rl_epsilon_decay).
- Discounted return for policy gradients:
  G_t = sum_{k=0}^inf gamma^k * r_{t+k+1}.

### 4.14 Optimization and scheduling
- RMSProp accumulator for gradient g:
  v' = beta * v + (1-beta) * g^2;
  g_adj = g / sqrt(v' + grad_epsilon).
- Learning rate scheduler:
  lr_{t+1} = clip(lr_t * scheduler_gamma, min_learning_rate, max_learning_rate).
- Epsilon scheduler analogous to learning rate scheduler.

### 4.15 Chaotic gating and phase adaptation
- Chaotic gate using logistic map:
  c_{t+1} = chaotic_gating_param * c_t * (1 - c_t).
- Phase update:
  phi_{t+1} = phi_t + phase_rate + phase_adaptation_rate * e.

### 4.16 Experience replay and memory gating
- Prioritized replay probability:
  P_i = (p_i^replay_alpha) / sum_j (p_j^replay_alpha).
- Importance weight:
  w_i = (1 / (N * P_i))^replay_beta.
- Memory gate value:
  g' = g * memory_gate_decay + memory_gate_strength * abs(e).
- Episodic path replay occurs with probability `episodic_memory_prob` for up to `episodic_sim_length` steps, applying the same
  synapse side effects as normal wandering.
