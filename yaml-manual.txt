The configuration YAML controls various aspects of the MARBLE system. The file is structured in a set of top-level sections, each containing parameters for a specific subsystem.

core:
  xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax: Bounds for the simulated space.
  width, height: Resolution of the core grid.
  max_iter: Maximum iterations for Mandelbrot calculations.
  vram_limit_mb, ram_limit_mb, disk_limit_mb: Resource limits for neuron tiers.

neuronenblitz:
  backtrack_probability, consolidation_probability,
  consolidation_strength, route_potential_increase,
  route_potential_decay, route_visit_decay_interval,
  alternative_connection_prob, split_probability,
  merge_tolerance, plasticity_threshold: Parameters that
  influence neuron routing and plasticity.

brain:
  save_threshold: Validation loss required before saving a model.
  max_saved_models: Number of saved checkpoints to keep.
  save_dir: Directory used to store checkpoints.
  firing_interval_ms: Interval between automatic firing cycles.
  initial_neurogenesis_factor: Starting multiplier for neurogenesis.
  offload_enabled: When true the brain will offload high
    attention lobes to a remote brain via HTTP.
  torrent_offload_enabled: When true the brain distributes lobes
    via the torrent offloading system.
  tier_decision_params:
    vram_usage_threshold, ram_usage_threshold: Thresholds used when
    selecting a growth tier.

formula: Optional formula used when constructing the core.
formula_num_neurons: Number of neurons used if the formula is provided.

meta_controller:
  history_length, adjustment, min_threshold, max_threshold: Parameters
  controlling adaptive thresholding.

neuromodulatory_system:
  initial: Starting values for arousal, stress, reward and emotion.

memory_system:
  long_term_path: File path used for persistent storage of memories.

remote_client:
  url: Base URL of a remote brain server.
  timeout: Request timeout in seconds.

torrent_client:
  client_id: Identifier for the torrent client.
  buffer_size: Maximum tasks buffered for asynchronous processing.
