The configuration YAML file controls all components of MARBLE.  Each top-level
section corresponds to a subsystem and exposes parameters that can be tuned to
alter its behaviour.

core:
  xmin: Minimum X coordinate for the Mandelbrot seed. Defines the left boundary
    of the complex plane used when initializing neuron values.
  xmax: Maximum X coordinate for the seed. Together with ``xmin`` this sets the
    horizontal span of the initial fractal.
  ymin: Minimum Y coordinate of the complex plane.
  ymax: Maximum Y coordinate of the complex plane.
  width: Horizontal resolution of the seed grid. Larger values produce more
    neurons but also require additional memory.
  height: Vertical resolution of the seed grid.
  max_iter: Number of Mandelbrot iterations to run. A higher count yields more
    detailed values. Must be greater than zero.
  vram_limit_mb: Maximum megabytes of GPU memory dedicated to VRAM tiers. If
    CUDA is unavailable this limit is merged into RAM.
  ram_limit_mb: Maximum megabytes of system memory used for RAM tiers.
  disk_limit_mb: Maximum megabytes for disk-based neuron tiers.

neuronenblitz:
  backtrack_probability: Probability between 0 and 1 that the wandering
    algorithm will revisit a previous neuron when exploring a path.
  consolidation_probability: Chance between 0 and 1 that an activated synapse
    will have its potential increased during consolidation.
  consolidation_strength: Multiplier applied when increasing synapse potential.
    Values above 1.0 accelerate learning while lower values slow it down.
  route_potential_increase: Amount added to a synapse's potential when it is
    traversed during activation.
  route_potential_decay: Factor applied periodically to reduce potentials of
    rarely used synapses. Typical range is 0.0–1.0.
  route_visit_decay_interval: Number of activations between decay steps
    specified by ``route_potential_decay``.
  alternative_connection_prob: Probability of creating a new random connection
    instead of following existing routes. Helps exploration of novel paths.
  split_probability: Likelihood that a wander branches into multiple paths at a
    neuron. Must be between 0 and 1.
  merge_tolerance: Maximum difference allowed between neuron values when merging
    converging paths. Small values enforce stricter merging behaviour.
  plasticity_threshold: Minimum potential a synapse must reach before structural
    changes such as adding or removing connections are applied.

brain:
  save_threshold: Minimum improvement in validation loss required before the
    brain writes a new checkpoint to disk.
  max_saved_models: Upper bound on the number of checkpoint files retained in
    ``save_dir``.
  save_dir: Directory where checkpoint files are stored.
  firing_interval_ms: Milliseconds between automatic firing cycles when
    auto-fire is active.
  initial_neurogenesis_factor: Starting multiplier that scales the amount of new
    neurons grown during neurogenesis.
  offload_enabled: When true, highly active lobes are sent to a remote brain
    server for processing.
  torrent_offload_enabled: When true, lobes may be distributed among torrent
    clients using the tracker system.
  mutation_rate: Fraction of synapses to mutate during each evolutionary step.
    Higher values introduce more variation but may destabilize learning.
  mutation_strength: Maximum absolute change applied to a mutated synapse's
    weight. Typical values range from 0.01 to 0.1.
  prune_threshold: Synapses with absolute weight below this value are removed
    during pruning, keeping the network efficient.
  dream_num_cycles: Default number of cycles executed each time the brain
    performs a background dreaming session. Values between 1 and 20 are common
    depending on how much consolidation is desired.
  dream_interval: Seconds to wait between consecutive dreaming sessions when
    ``start_dreaming`` runs in the background. Short intervals keep memory
    consolidation frequent but consume more processing time.
  tier_decision_params:
    vram_usage_threshold: Fraction of VRAM usage that triggers migration of
      neurons to a lower tier.
    ram_usage_threshold: Fraction of RAM usage that triggers migration to disk
      or file tiers.

formula: Mathematical expression used to compute initial neuron values instead
  of the Mandelbrot seed. If omitted the Mandelbrot algorithm is used.
formula_num_neurons: Number of neurons created when ``formula`` is provided.

meta_controller:
  # The meta-controller monitors validation losses and adjusts
  # ``neuronenblitz.plasticity_threshold`` accordingly. If losses rise the
  # threshold is lowered so structural changes become less likely. When losses
  # fall it increases the threshold within the allowed range to encourage more
  # exploration. This keeps learning stable over long runs.
  history_length: Number of recent validation losses used for the adjustment.
    Typical values range from 3 to 20 depending on how quickly adaptation should
    react.
  adjustment: Amount by which the plasticity threshold changes when performance
    improves or degrades. Values between 0.1 and 1.0 are common.
  min_threshold: Lower bound for the plasticity threshold. Should remain above
    zero, often around 0.5–5.0.
  max_threshold: Upper bound for the plasticity threshold. Values around
    10–50 keep the system from becoming too rigid.

neuromodulatory_system:
  # Represents the internal state of the brain. Arousal and reward boost
  # neurogenesis while stress suppresses it. Emotion provides a qualitative tag
  # that may be used by higher-level modules. Values typically lie between 0.0
  # and 1.0 and change dynamically during training.
  initial:
    arousal: Baseline arousal level in the range 0.0–1.0. Higher arousal
      increases neurogenesis rates.
    stress: Initial stress level in the range 0.0–1.0. Stress reduces
      plasticity and slows learning.
    reward: Starting reward signal in the range 0.0–1.0 that encourages
      reinforcement of successful pathways.
    emotion: Starting emotional state for the system. ``"neutral"`` is typical
      but any descriptive string is allowed.

memory_system:
  # Provides short-term memory in RAM and long-term memory on disk. The system
  # consolidates entries from the volatile store into the persistent file when
  # required.
  long_term_path: Path to the file used for persistent long-term storage of
    memories.
  threshold: When ``arousal`` or ``reward`` exceed this value the
    ``MemorySystem`` stores new entries directly in the long-term layer instead
    of the short-term layer. Typical values range from 0.3 to 0.7 depending on
    how aggressively long-term consolidation should occur.

remote_client:
  # Configuration for forwarding parts of the brain to a remote server. When
  # ``offload_enabled`` is true the brain serializes a subcore and sends it to
  # this endpoint for processing.
  url: Base URL for the remote HTTP brain server.
  timeout: Seconds to wait for remote requests before they are aborted. Values
    between 5 and 30 are typical depending on network latency.

torrent_client:
  # Enables distribution of brain parts through the tracker network. Each client
  # processes assigned subcores asynchronously.
  client_id: Identifier used when registering with the torrent tracker. Must be
    unique across participating clients.
  buffer_size: Maximum number of asynchronous tasks queued for a torrent
    client. Larger values allow more parallel requests but use more memory.

data_compressor:
  # Controls how strongly the DataCompressor reduces data size before it is
  # stored or transmitted.
  compression_level: Integer from 0 to 9 passed directly to ``zlib.compress``.
    Higher levels yield smaller output but require more CPU time. The default of
    6 balances speed and ratio for general use.
