The configuration YAML file controls all components of MARBLE.  Each top-level
section corresponds to a subsystem and exposes parameters that can be tuned to
alter its behaviour.

core:
  xmin: Minimum X coordinate for the Mandelbrot seed. Defines the left boundary
    of the complex plane used when initializing neuron values.
  xmax: Maximum X coordinate for the seed. Together with ``xmin`` this sets the
    horizontal span of the initial fractal.
  ymin: Minimum Y coordinate of the complex plane.
  ymax: Maximum Y coordinate of the complex plane.
  width: Horizontal resolution of the seed grid. Larger values produce more
    neurons but also require additional memory.
  height: Vertical resolution of the seed grid.
  max_iter: Number of Mandelbrot iterations to run. A higher count yields more
    detailed values. Must be greater than zero.
  vram_limit_mb: Maximum megabytes of GPU memory dedicated to VRAM tiers. If
    CUDA is unavailable this limit is merged into RAM.
  ram_limit_mb: Maximum megabytes of system memory used for RAM tiers.
  disk_limit_mb: Maximum megabytes for disk-based neuron tiers.

neuronenblitz:
  backtrack_probability: Probability between 0 and 1 that the wandering
    algorithm will revisit a previous neuron when exploring a path.
  consolidation_probability: Chance between 0 and 1 that an activated synapse
    will have its potential increased during consolidation.
  consolidation_strength: Multiplier applied when increasing synapse potential.
    Values above 1.0 accelerate learning while lower values slow it down.
  route_potential_increase: Amount added to a synapse's potential when it is
    traversed during activation.
  route_potential_decay: Factor applied periodically to reduce potentials of
    rarely used synapses. Typical range is 0.0–1.0.
  route_visit_decay_interval: Number of activations between decay steps
    specified by ``route_potential_decay``.
  alternative_connection_prob: Probability of creating a new random connection
    instead of following existing routes. Helps exploration of novel paths.
  split_probability: Likelihood that a wander branches into multiple paths at a
    neuron. Must be between 0 and 1.
  merge_tolerance: Maximum difference allowed between neuron values when merging
    converging paths. Small values enforce stricter merging behaviour.
  plasticity_threshold: Minimum potential a synapse must reach before structural
    changes such as adding or removing connections are applied.

brain:
  save_threshold: Minimum improvement in validation loss required before the
    brain writes a new checkpoint to disk.
  max_saved_models: Upper bound on the number of checkpoint files retained in
    ``save_dir``.
  save_dir: Directory where checkpoint files are stored.
  firing_interval_ms: Milliseconds between automatic firing cycles when
    auto-fire is active.
  initial_neurogenesis_factor: Starting multiplier that scales the amount of new
    neurons grown during neurogenesis.
  offload_enabled: When true, highly active lobes are sent to a remote brain
    server for processing.
  torrent_offload_enabled: When true, lobes may be distributed among torrent
    clients using the tracker system.
  tier_decision_params:
    vram_usage_threshold: Fraction of VRAM usage that triggers migration of
      neurons to a lower tier.
    ram_usage_threshold: Fraction of RAM usage that triggers migration to disk
      or file tiers.

formula: Mathematical expression used to compute initial neuron values instead
  of the Mandelbrot seed. If omitted the Mandelbrot algorithm is used.
formula_num_neurons: Number of neurons created when ``formula`` is provided.

meta_controller:
  history_length: Number of recent validation losses tracked before adjusting
    neuronenblitz plasticity.
  adjustment: Amount by which the plasticity threshold changes when performance
    improves or degrades.
  min_threshold: Lower bound for the plasticity threshold.
  max_threshold: Upper bound for the plasticity threshold.

neuromodulatory_system:
  initial:
    arousal: Baseline arousal level in the range 0.0–1.0. Higher arousal
      increases neurogenesis rates.
    stress: Initial stress level in the range 0.0–1.0. Stress reduces
      plasticity and slows learning.
    reward: Starting reward signal in the range 0.0–1.0 that encourages
      reinforcement of successful pathways.
    emotion: Starting emotional state for the system. ``"neutral"`` is typical
      but any descriptive string is allowed.

memory_system:
  long_term_path: Path to the file used for persistent long-term storage of
    memories.

remote_client:
  url: Base URL for a remote HTTP brain server used when ``offload_enabled`` is
    true.
  timeout: Seconds to wait for remote requests before they are aborted.

torrent_client:
  client_id: Identifier used when registering with the torrent tracker.
  buffer_size: Maximum number of asynchronous tasks queued for a torrent
    client.
