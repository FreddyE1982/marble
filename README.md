# MARBLE

**Mandelbrot Adaptive Reasoning Brain-Like Engine**

The MARBLE system is a modular neural architecture that begins with a Mandelbrot-inspired seed and adapts through neuromodulatory feedback and structural plasticity. This repository contains the source code for the system along with utilities and configuration files.
