# MARBLE

**Mandelbrot Adaptive Reasoning Brain-Like Engine**

The MARBLE system is a modular neural architecture that begins with a Mandelbrot-inspired seed and adapts through neuromodulatory feedback and structural plasticity. This repository contains the source code for the system along with utilities and configuration files.

## Possible MARBLE Backcronyms

Below is a list of ideas explored when naming the project:

- Mandelbrot Adaptive Reasoning Brain-Like Engine
- Multi-Agent Reinforcement-Based Learning Environment
- Modular Architecture for Rapid Brain-Like Experimentation
- Memory-Augmented Recursive Bayesian Learning Engine
- Metaheuristic Adaptive Reinforcement-Based Learning Ecosystem
- Multimodal Analytical Response Behavior Learning Entity
- Machine-Augmented Reflective Belief Learning Engine
- Morphological Adaptive Robotics Brain-Like Executor
- Multi-sensory Associative Response and Behavior Learning Engine
- Matrix-Accelerated Reasoning Bot with Learning Enhancements
For a high level description of the system components and data flow see [ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md). The YAML configuration format is documented in detail in [yaml-manual.txt](yaml-manual.txt).
