# Neuron and Synapse Templates

This directory collects reusable templates for creating custom neuron and synapse
classes. Copy these files and extend them when implementing new building blocks
for MARBLE experiments. The following templates are provided:

* ``neuron_template.py`` – Starting point for simple neuron implementations.
* ``rnn_neuron_template.py`` – Demonstrates a recurrent neuron with internal state.
* ``synapse_template.py`` – Basic synapse wiring example.
* ``gating_synapse_template.py`` – Shows how to build a synapse that gates signals.
