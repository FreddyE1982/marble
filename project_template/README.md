# Marble Project Template

This template provides a minimal starting point for new MARBLE-based projects.
It contains a sample configuration file and a short script that trains a small
model. Copy the entire directory and adapt the code as needed.

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the example trainer:
   ```bash
   python exampletrain.py --config config.yaml
   ```
